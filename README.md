## Description

This 3D-printed thread saver is designed specifically for New Brothread “Huge” embroidery thread spools.

Its primary purpose is to grip and secure the loose end of the thread, preventing it from unraveling or tangling when the spool is not in use. The angled, tapered slits provide a controlled friction grip while still allowing the thread to be inserted and pulled out cleanly.

The insert also happens to give the spool a slightly more stable footprint, since it gives the spool a flat bottom.

This model was dimensioned directly from the real spool using calipers and tuned for a firm press fit. It was printed and tested on a Bambu Lab P1S using Bambu Basic PLA (Bambu Green) with standard settings. PLA fits snugly as designed; PETG may require a small negative scale (-0.5% to -1%) depending on your machine.

Ideal for embroiderers who want a clean, simple way to keep thread tails under control and prevent tangles during storage or transport.
